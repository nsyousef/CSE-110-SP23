## About Me

I am a fourth year bioinformatics major at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I plan to graduate in Spring 2023. After graduation, I plan to work at Medtronic, a medical device company. I am really interested in the intersection between medicine and technology, specifically software. In my free time, I enjoy travelling, spending time with my family, and playing board games with my friends.
